                            Latina. Mother. Backend veteran coder with a hankerin's for hiking and outdoor activities.
                            I'm an enthusiastic team player, dedicated to enhancing my skillset, working experience and relationships with people.
                            I love to spend extra precious time with my son building legos and drawing dinasours.

                            In my free time I practice kickboxing and jungshin, a wooden sword based martial art.
                            Why a sword? Let me explain it to you since I do need more text to make this page similar to the homework's assigment.
                            <br>
                            Through out human history the meaning of the sword always represented a force to fight. Over centuries the significance of the sword as a means to engaging one's concentration and focus, eliciting an acute sense of power and effectiveness in combat has remained consistent throughout the ages.
                            Loaded movement is beneficial to balance, health, and access to true core in so many ways. Growing up I used play piano and field hockey, and now I spend about 10 hours in front of my laptop, so my spine and wrist joints aren't so happy at all.  
                            Luckily, I found jungshin and I've picked up the sword as a tool to help strengthen the muscles supporting my spine
